Miniset

When this dataset is loaded for a model:
Case a.), we don't have feature files yet for this combinations of settings and dataset. We will cook it into Logs folder in .npy files. Continue normally.
Case b.) We load the feature files and use them for training (for image_only and mixed models).

Settings1:

    Settings["experiment_name"] = "FolderNameForTheExperiment"
    Settings["graph_histories"] = ['together']

    n=0
    Settings["models"][n]["model_type"] = 'img_osm_mix' # 'simple_cnn_with_top', 'img_osm_mix', 'osm_only'
    Settings["models"][n]["dataset_name"] = "miniset_640px"
    Settings["models"][n]["pixels"] = 640
    Settings["models"][n]["cnn_model"] = 'resnet50'
    Settings["models"][n]["unique_id"] = 'uniqueNameForThisModelInFutureGraphs'
    Settings["models"][n]["cooking_method"] = 'generators'
    Settings["models"][n]["epochs"] = 500
    Settings["models"][n]["dump_file_override"] = 'SegmentsData_mark100.dump'


Miniset extended

We check for the existence of the target folfer and target dump file. If we can find them, we will load them and continue as in normal case.
Otherwise we copy the source folders images, and extend the dataset generating new images. We will also save a new dump file and then continue with it as the main dump file.
We carry on like in regular case, only we are using a newly created dataset with it's new dataset dump file.
Naturally with a new dataset we need to cook features, but we leave that upon the already existing structures.
